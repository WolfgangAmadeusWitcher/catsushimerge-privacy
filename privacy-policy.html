    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 7, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Cat Sushi Merge ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application ("App").</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <p>Our App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements and Firebase (Analytics &amp; Crashlytics) to understand app performance and improve stability. Through these services, certain information may be collected automatically, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers (such as Advertising ID / IDFA)</li>
        <li>IP address (may be used to derive coarse location)</li>
        <li>Device information (model, operating system version)</li>
        <li>App usage data and interactions (including interactions with advertisements)</li>
        <li>Diagnostics (such as crash logs and performance data)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
    <p>Our App does not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Require user registration or accounts</li>
        <li>Collect personal information such as name, email, or phone number</li>
        <li>Access your contacts, camera, microphone, or precise location (GPS)</li>
        <li>Store any personal data on our servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The information collected through third-party services is used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display relevant advertisements</li>
        <li>Measure ad performance</li>
        <li>Prevent fraud and abuse</li>
        <li>Understand app usage and improve features</li>
        <li>Monitor app stability and fix crashes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our App uses the following third-party services:</p>

    <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and process data as described in Google's Privacy Policy. For more information, please visit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob Policies</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Firebase (Analytics &amp; Crashlytics)</h3>
    <p>We use Firebase Analytics to understand app usage and Firebase Crashlytics to detect, diagnose, and fix stability issues. Firebase may collect and process data as described in Google's Privacy Policy and Firebase Privacy information. For more information, please visit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Audience & Child Safety</h2>
    <p>Cat Sushi Merge is suitable for a general audience, including younger players, but it is not directed primarily at children. We configure our advertising services to show G-rated ad content and do not use child-directed treatment flags.</p>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can remove it.</p>

    <h2>Consent & Regional Requirements</h2>
    <p>We use Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP) to handle consent in regions where it is required (for example, the European Economic Area). When required, users are shown a consent form and can choose between personalized and non-personalized ads. Outside those regions, consent is not requested.</p>
    <p>On iOS, we may also request App Tracking Transparency permission. If you do not allow tracking, we request non-personalized ads.</p>
    <p>Until consent for personalized ads is obtained, we request non-personalized advertisements. You can revisit your choices through your device's ad privacy settings or by clearing app data.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Game progress (such as high scores and unlocked items) is stored locally on your device using standard device storage. This data is not transmitted to any external servers and remains entirely on your device.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can limit ad tracking on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Go to Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Tracking, then disable tracking permissions for the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Go to Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also reset your advertising identifier or delete the App at any time to remove locally stored data.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All data transmitted through third-party services (ads, analytics, and crash reporting) is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
